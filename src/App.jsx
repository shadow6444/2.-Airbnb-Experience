/* Challenge:
One LAST time in this course, set up a React app from scratch
- Render an <App /> component
    - App should be in its own file
- App should render 4-5 <Joke /> components 
  (Joke component defined in its own file too)
    - Each Joke should receive a "setup" prop and a "punchline" prop
      and render those however you'd like
- Use your favorite 2-part jokes (setup & punchline), or check
  jokes.md file for some examples.



EXTRA CREDIT:
Some jokes are only a punchline with no setup:

E.g.: "Itâ€™s hard to explain puns to kleptomaniacs because 
they always take things literally."

If you don't pass in a "question" prop, how might you make it only 
show the punchline?

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Joke
        setup="Setup: I got my daughter a fridge for her birthday."
        punchline="Punchline: I can't wait to see her face light up when she opens it."
      />
      <Joke
        setup="Setup: How did the hacker escape the police?"
        punchline="Punchline: He just ransomware!"
      />
    </>
  );
